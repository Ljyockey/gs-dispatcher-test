The goal of this exercise is to make all tests defined in `eventDispatcher.spec.js` pass.

You are not allowed to modify the tests themselves.
You are free to use whichever syntax you're comfortable with.
You can use the internet to look up the syntax but not the solution to the problem.

To run the tests, open `index.html` in a browser and you'll see the errors displayed on the page,
that should be enough to get you started.

You have 50 minutes to do the test. Good luck!
